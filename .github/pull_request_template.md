# REPLACE_ME_WITH_A_DESCRIPTIVE_TITLE

**REPLACE_ME_WITH_A_LINK**

To facilitate the whole submission process I confirm that

- [ ] I've read and understood the [Contribution Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md);
- [ ] I've accepted the terms of the [CC0 License](../LICENSE);
- [ ] I've provided a descriptive commit message (pull request description),
  not the `Updated README.md`.

I submit

- [ ] a link to the [Inbox](../inbox.md) with a resource I found interesting
  but I don't have extensive experience with;
- [ ] a link to a resource I created myself with
  - [ ] the `RubyNLP` project's logo
    [![Awesome RubyNLP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Awesome-RubyNLP-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/arbox/nlp-with-ruby)
    after the resource's README title;
- [ ] a link to a resource I've got extensive expertise in and provide
  a tutorial, which
  - [ ] has a `Gemfile`,
  - [ ] has a test suite with runnable examples from the tutorial,
  - [ ] has the tutorial text in `markdown` or `org` format.


Thank you for filling out this form :) It helps us to please you with
a quality resource!
