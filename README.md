This curated list comprizes _awesome_ resources, libraries, information sources about Processing of Human Languages with Ruby.
We plan to provide not only links but also a short _tutorial_ for every included tool.
Any help, suggestions and contributions are welcome. Please read the [contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Todo List
* [ ] Create the directory structure for turorials with named tools.
* [ ] Find an appropriate main entry structure with a license badge.
* [ ] Create a tag system for non hierarchical entry classification, use colored badges.

## NLP Pipeline Subtasks

### Segmentation

Tokenization, Word and Sentence Boundary Detection and Disambiguation

* [tokenizer](https://github.com/arbox/tokenizer) - a simple multilingual tokenizer.
* [Pragmatic Tokenizer](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_tokenizer) - a multilingual tokenizer to split a string into tokens
* [NLP Pure](https://github.com/parhamr/nlp-pure) - natural language processing algorithms implemented in pure Ruby with minimal dependencies
* [Textoken](https://github.com/manorie/textoken) - simple and customizable text tokenization library.
* [Pragmatic Segmenter](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter) - WBD tool with many cookies.
* [Punkt Segmenter](https://github.com/lfcipriani/punkt-segmenter) - Ruby implementation of the Punkt Segmenter.
* [TactfulTokenizer](https://github.com/zencephalon/Tactful_Tokenizer) - RegExp based tokenizer for different languages.
* [Scapel](https://github.com/louismullie/scalpel) - SBD tool.

### Lexical Processing

#### Stemming

Stemming is the term used in linguistic morphology and information retrieval to describe the process for reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form.

* [Ruby-Stemmer](https://github.com/aurelian/ruby-stemmer) - Ruby-Stemmer exposes the SnowBall API to Ruby
* [uea-stemmer](https://github.com/ealdent/uea-stemmer) - a conservative stemmer for search and indexing
